            <h2>What Causes the Radio Emission in Seyfert Galaxies: SF or AGN?</h2>
            <p>Motivated by the importance of radio jets in galactic feedback, my Ph.D. research primarily focused on deciphering the origins of radio emissions in Seyfert galaxies. Utilizing the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) polarimetric observations, our investigations provided evidence that radio emissions in Seyfert galaxies are predominantly related to jets. Future work involves a deeper exploration of the impact of radio jets on the environment, particularly understanding the interaction between polarized emissions and surrounding multi-phase gas.</p>

Right: Overlay of the contours representing the HST WFPC2 Hα + [N II] line emission in blue over the VLA A-array image at 1.4 GHz of NGC 3079. There is no one-to-one correlation between the emission line intensity and radio emission. We hence rule out magnetic fields frozen in with the superwinds (Sebastian et al. 2019a).</figcaption>

            <h2>Discovering Binary Black Holes using VLBA:</h2>
            <p>The pre-final stage of galaxy mergers, black hole binaries is an ideal laboratory to study the dynamics of SMBH binary systems. Although several indirect tracers of SMBH binaries are reported in the literature, confirmation of their existence has proven challenging. Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) is an extremely valuable technique for identifying SMBH binaries. Its high angular resolution helps zoom in to pc-scales at the center of galaxies. We observed a sample of six double-peaked AGN showing X-shaped morphology with VLBA and found that three out of the six possess dual radio peaks. In addition to these three sources, we chose two highly likely sources identified in the literature to be followed up at a second frequency using the VLBA. All the sources showed dual radio core-like morphology in at least one previous VLBA epoch. We have been awarded 45 hours to confirm whether these are indeed binary black holes (BBH) and characterize any variability in their radio flux densities.</p>

              <h2>Epoch of reionization: studying radio properties of local analogs</h2>
               <p>In one of my first-author publications titled ‘Radio continuum emission from local analogs of high-z faint LAEs: Blueberry galaxies,’ we investigated the origin of low-frequency radio continuum emission in ten Blueberry galaxies using uGMRT at 1.4 GHz. In particular, we examined the cause of the radio emission deficit in these systems. As a follow-up, we have acquired ∼90 hours of uGMRT data for an ensemble of Blueberry and Green pea galaxies at two different wavebands to undertake spectral analysis, which will be crucial in differentiating between the thermal vs. non-thermal components. We also acquired VLA observations of two Green pea galaxies, which showed NLS1-like properties to understand the jets and accretion activity in
                these systems. In addition, I am also involved in two studies that explore the HI emission from these systems.</p>


            <h2>Radio Mode Feedback in Voorwerp Galaxy, NGC 5972:</h2>
            <p>‘Voorwerp galaxies’ are a peculiar class of galaxies discovered by the citizen scientists in the galaxy
zoo project. They exhibit bright green extended emission that is believed to be quasar ionization echoes. Arshi Ali, a master’s student, is working under my supervision to understand whether the extended [O III] emission in NGC 5972, a Voorwerp, and a radio-loud galaxy could result from jet-related feedback. We have used the archival VLT-MUSE data and newly acquired uGMRT data to study any connection between the radio and the extended emission-line regions (EELR). Figure 4 illustrates some signatures of jet-related feedback in this galaxy. Our optical line diagnostics analysis and shock modeling (Fig. 4 right) show evidence of jet-induced shock in the transverse direction. Fig. 4 (lef) shows the difference in the stellar and the [O III] emission line velocities. The larger values along the jet axis support the idea of a jet-driven outflow.</p>

            <h2>Emission Mechanisms of X-ray Jets:</h2>
            <p>With the launch of the Chandra observatory, the potential to study spatially resolved jets in the X-ray band became evident. Through observations of hybrid MOJAVE blazars, we aimed to determine the preferred emission model between FR I and FR II jets. While IC-CMB model reproduces the broadband SED, it faces several physical challenges including the overprediction of gamma-ray emission. Initial results suggest the need to explore alternative models, including multiple synchrotron components and shear layer acceleration. (Sebastian et al. 2022)</p>

The inset image shows the X-ray core and jet overlaid with the radio contours from the VLA A-array image at 1.4 GHz. The black data points correspond to the emission from the extended jet region obtained from the VLA, HST, and Chandra images. The magenta upper limit points represent the gamma-ray flux from the 4FGL source catalog and were not used for fitting. The gamma-ray emission predicted by the IC-CMB model is higher than the gamma-ray data points.</figcaption>

        <h2>Interaction of head-tail galaxies with the ICM:</h2>
        <p> Head–tail radio galaxies form a unique class of cosmic entities characterized by their distinct morphology of a central "head" and two trailing "tails." These galaxies, often found within galaxy clusters, offer a fascinating glimpse into the interplay between cosmic forces. Sebastian et al. 2017 focus on a detailed study of seven such head–tail radio galaxies using Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) data. We aimed to unravel the dynamics shaping these enigmatic structures, exploring their magnetic fields, spectral characteristics, and the spatial variations in polarization patterns. Ultimately, my research seeks to deepen our understanding of the dynamics of these cosmic giants and their role as probes of the cluster environment.</p>
